## Overview
This dashboard surfaces the combination of two data sets:
* 311 Noise Complaints (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Noise-Complaints/p5f6-bkga)
* The model outputs from this capstone project, including the predicted enforceability probability

## Access
The dashboard is currently uploaded to Tableau Public at https://public.tableau.com/profile/sam.ovenshine#!/vizhome/DEPDashboard/HeatMap.

It is also embedded at https://zem232.github.io/NoiseCapstone/ using the Tableau JavaScript API library.

## How to Use
There are three versions (not layers) of the map, which are toggleable with the Select view form:
* Complaints: Open 311 noise complaint points by location
* Heatmap: Density-based clusters of 311 noise complaints
* Both: Complaint points overlaid on density clusters

Data is filterable by the **Created Date** (at any date level), **Descriptor** (e.g. Noise, Barking Dog, Noise: Alarms), **Enforceability Priority** (predicted enforceability probability on a 0-1 range input), **Open AHV Near Complaint** (binary whether there was an open AHV at the Created Date within 200 meters of the complaint location), **Days Open** (calendar day difference between the Created Date and the current date), **Highest Enforceability** (filter to the most enforceable points).

**Color By** allows a toggle between Enforceability and Open AHV Status to show color of points based on their predicted enforceability or on whether there is an AHV.

The maps can be navigated by clicking and dragging. Zooming in and out is accomplished with two-finger touch or scroll.

More information about the complaint is available on hover in the tooltip. Points can be selected or filtered on click.

The widgets on the left bar (Complaints, High-Enforceability Complaints) are active and updated with filters and selections.

## Dependencies
The dashboard takes as input two CSV files, open_complaints.csv and closed_complaints.csv. These files are generated by the model script. Tableau reads them in as extracts.

The dashboard was built with Tableau Desktop 2019.2 and uploaded to Tableau Public, where it can be edited with a free Tableau account.

## Productionization
Productionization would require the following:
* A server/service on which to run the model script at a given time schedule and output the CSV files from the model
* Tableau Server to refresh the file extract
* Tableau Server to display the dashboard for optimal user experience and **performance**
* Access to real-time 311 data to show data not on a lag
